Question
Can I predict a start up’s potential for venture capital or angel investment? 
Crunchbase provides in open data map (CSV) of start-ups that includes information like the name of the organization, location and social presence. Crunchbase also offers API to access information more relevant to answering my question:
*Valuation
*IPO (if any)
*Fundraise
*Acquisition
There is no Python wrapper on Crunchbase’s site. 
I’m interested in learning more about how VC’s and angel investors identify value in start-ups.
